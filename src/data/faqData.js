      answer:
        "Of course! We welcome all levels of experience to our club. Our club currently has members who started playing rugby as soon as they could walk as well as players who had never touched a rugby ball until their first practice with us. Our coaches and veteran players will teach you everything you need to know to feel confident playing your first match.",
